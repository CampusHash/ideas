Rock-Paper-Scissors
===========================

_Difficulty_: __Intermediate__

A game of rock-paper-scissors with the computer. The user gets the option of playing over a session and then gets an overview.

## Specifications ##

The computer should select the weapon most likely to beat the user, based on the user’s previous choice of weapons. 
For instance, if the user has selected _paper_ 3 times but _rock_ and _scissors_ only 1 time each, the computer should 
choose _scissors_ as the weapon most likely to beat _paper_, which is the user’s most frequent choice so far.
